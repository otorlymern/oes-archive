# oes-archive
OES Archive contains documents on A/V equipment, analog recording gear, tape machines, synthesizers, and the like. The intention is simply to gather like documents in one place for the convenience of anyone interested.

Contents:
- `resources/`: reference PDFs and manuals (tracked with Git LFS).
- `textures/`: texture PNGs used around the OES projects.

After cloning, run `git lfs install` and `git lfs pull` to fetch the large PDF assets.
